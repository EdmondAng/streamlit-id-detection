# ID Card and Passport Detection
I have created a (streamlit app)[https://id-card-passport-detection.streamlit.app/] to distinguish ID card and passport submissions. The underlying model uses YOLOv5l, trained on 500 ID card and 500 passport photos from Europe and North/West Asia. You may find out more about the model behind the app by visiting my [Github](https://github.com/EdmondAng/my_materials) > "01. Object detection using YOLOv5 for ID cards and passports".
